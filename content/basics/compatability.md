As this is a collection of shell scripts, there aren't many dependencies. See [Native Dependencies](/basics/dependencies/) for explicitly required program list.

### Linux or MacOS

For Linux or MacOS, you hopefully don't need to configure anything extra, it should work by default.

### Android

Install [Termux](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Main_Page) and done.

It's fully tested for all usecases of this script.

### iOS

Install [iSH](https://ish.app/)

While it has not been officially tested, but should work given the description of the app. Report if you got it working by creating an issue.

### Windows

Use [Windows Subsystem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)

Again, it has not been officially tested on windows, there shouldn't be anything preventing it from working. Report if you got it working by creating an issue.
