      <description>For uploading files/remote gdrive files, the syntax is simple;
gupload filename/foldername/file_id/file_link -c gdrive_folder_name where filename/foldername is input file/folder and gdrive_folder_name is the name of the folder on gdrive, where the input file/folder will be uploaded.
and file_id/file_link is the accessible gdrive file link or id which will be uploaded without downloading.
If gdrive_folder_name is present on gdrive, then script will upload there, else will make a folder with that name.</description>

      <title>Sync Script</title>
      <link>https://labbots.github.io/google-drive-upload/usage/sync/</link>

      <description>This repo also provides an additional script ( sync.bash or sync.sh ) to utilise gupload for synchronisation jobs, i.e background jobs.
Basic Usage To create a sync job, just run
gsync folder_name -d gdrive_folder
Here, folder_name is the local folder you want to sync and gdrive_folder is google drive folder name.
In the local folder, all the contents present or added in the future will be automatically uploaded.
Note: Giving gdrive_folder is optional, if you don&amp;rsquo;t specify a name with -d/&amp;ndash;directory flags, then it will upload in the root folder set by gupload command.</description>
